# TrainScheduler

This project displays a  train schedule where trains can be added using Firebase to store data, moment to manipulate the dates and jQuery to manipulate the DOM. All other specs of page are crafted using html, and css. 

This page lets users input train info and then uses it to manipulate and display the data accordingly. Here we can visualize appreciate how jQuery can be used to manipulate the document element model and make the webpage more dynamic while using other tools like Firebase to store data and moment to manipulate dates. 

To install or try out the project users need a browser and open up the html.

Users can get further help in w3shcools or MDN or stockoverflow.
